      "text": "Simon is rescue dog that Sunny keeps around her shop. He shows love to everybody who comes in. Why? Because he’s been shown love in this place. And that’s what Sunny shows to everybody who walks in her door. I watched her and the staff offer dignity and respect to two of our “neighbors on the street” who came in for haircuts. To Sunny, there are no strays—just four legged and two legged friends. Oh, and her haircuts rock, too!",
