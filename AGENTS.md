# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/` contains the React application entry points (`main.jsx`) and UI code (`App.jsx`, `components/`).
- `src/assets/` holds static assets bundled by Vite; `public/` is for files copied as-is.
- `src/data/` contains local data sources used by the UI.
- `scripts/` holds one-off tooling (e.g., `fetch-reviews.js` for review data).
- `dist/` is the build output (generated by `npm run build`).

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm run dev`: start the Vite dev server with HMR for local development.
- `npm run build`: create the production bundle in `dist/`.
- `npm run preview`: serve the production build locally for verification.
- `npm run lint`: run ESLint across the project.
- `npm run fetch-reviews`: fetch review data via `scripts/fetch-reviews.js`.
- `npm run predeploy` / `npm run deploy`: build and publish `dist/` to GitHub Pages.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Use 2-space indentation and modern ES modules (`type: module` in `package.json`).
- React components use PascalCase (e.g., `HeroBanner.jsx`); hooks and utilities use camelCase.
- Keep JSX in `*.jsx` files; use `App.css`/`index.css` for global styles and component-level CSS where appropriate.
- Linting is enforced by `eslint.config.js` with React Hooks and React Refresh rules.

## Testing Guidelines
- There is no test framework configured yet; add one if introducing non-trivial logic.
- If adding tests, prefer colocating them next to the source file (e.g., `Component.test.jsx`).
- Document any new test commands in `package.json` and update this guide.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Recent history shows short, generic messages (e.g., “Updating”); no formal convention is enforced.
- Use clear, imperative commit messages that describe the change (e.g., “Add hero section layout”).
- PRs should include a concise summary, testing notes, and screenshots for UI changes.

## Configuration & Data Notes
- Review data is fetched via `scripts/fetch-reviews.js`; check any required env vars in that script.
- Keep `dist/` out of manual edits; always rebuild via `npm run build`.
